# Orca Typescript SDK

The Orca SDK contains a set of simple to use APIs to allow developers to integrate with the Orca exchange platform.

Learn more Orca [here](https://docs.orca.so).

### Trading Orca Liquidity Pools

- Get detailed quotes and make swaps between trading pairs in an Orca Pool
- Check your Orca Pool LP token balance and total supply

**Supported Orca Pools**

- The SDK supports all pools currently listed on [Orca](https://www.orca.so/pools)

### Provide Liquidity to Orca Pools

- Deposit liquidity to supported Orca Pools
  - Deposit a trading pair, and receive LP token
- Withdraw liquidity from supported Orca Pools
  - Withdraw a trading pair in exchange for LP token

**Aquafarm Support**

- After depositing liquidtiy to a pool, the LP token can be deposited into
  the corresponding farm to receive an equivalent amount of farm token
- Remember to withdraw the LP token in exchange for farm token before
  withdrawing liquidity from Orca Pool

**Features Coming Soon**

- More trader information (APY, Volume)

# Installation

Use your environment's package manager to install @orca-so/sdk and other related packages into your project.

```bash
yarn add @orca-so/sdk @solana/web3.js decimal.js
```

```bash
npm install @orca-so/sdk @solana/web3.js decimal.js
```

# Usage

```typescript
import { Connection, Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { getOrca, OrcaPoolConfig, OrcaU64 } from "@orca-so/sdk";

try {
  const connection = new Connection(url, "singleGossip");
  const orca = getOrca(connection);
  const owner: Keypair = getKeyPair();

  // Get an instance of the ETH-USDC orca pool
  let pool = orca.getPool(OrcaPoolConfig.ETH_USDC);

  // Get the number of ETH-USDC LP tokens in your wallet
  let ethUsdcLPBalance = await pool.getLPBalance(owner.publicKey);

  // Get the total supply of ETH-USDC LP tokens
  let ethUsdcLPSupply = await pool.getLPSupply();

  // Get a quote of exchanging 1.1 ETH to USDC with a slippage tolerance of 0.1%
  // From the quote, you can get the current rate, fees, expected output amount and minimum output amount
  let ethToken = pool.getTokenA();
  let tradeValue = new Decimal(1.1);
  let quote = await pool.getQuote(ethToken, tradeValue, new Decimal(0.1));

  // Perform a swap for 1USDC to the quoted minimum amount of ETH
  // If the user does not have the Associated Token Address(ATA) to receive the output token, the ATA
  // instructions will be appended in the transaction.
  const txId = await pool.swap(owner, usdcToken, tradeValue, quote.getMinOutputAmount()).execute();
} catch (err) {
  // Handle errors
}
```

# Technical Notes

**Decimals & OrcaU64**

The SDK relies on the use of [Decimal](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js/) for number inputs and Decimal/[OrcaU64](https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk/blob/main/src/public/utils/orca-u64.ts) for token-value inputs. If a Decimal instance is provided for a token-value input, it will be automatically transformed to the token's scale.

**Stability of the Public Util Functions**

We hope you find the tools we used to build our API useful in the public/utils folder. Due to our on-going development of the Orca platform, we cannot guarrantee the stability of the util APIs. The trading APIs can only be upgraded on major version updates.
