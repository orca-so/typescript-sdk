⚠️ **WARNING: DEPRECATED TYPESCRIPT SDK** ⚠️

This Typescript SDK is for the **legacy pools** which are **deprecated**. We highly recommend you to use the **Whirlpools SDK** for the new and improved pools. You can find it here:

🌊 [Whirlpools SDK on npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orca-so/whirlpools-sdk) 🌊

Please update your implementations to avoid any issues or disruptions in the future.

# Orca Typescript SDK

The Orca SDK contains a set of simple to use APIs to allow developers to integrate with the Orca platform.

Learn more Orca [here](https://docs.orca.so).

### Orca Token Swap V2

- The [Orca Token Swap V2 program](https://solscan.io/account/9W959DqEETiGZocYWCQPaJ6sBmUzgfxXfqGeTEdp3aQP) uses the following commit hash of the SPL Token Swap program: [3613cea3](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/3613cea3cabbb5f7e4445d6203b7292d413732da/token-swap)

### Trading Orca Liquidity Pools

- Get detailed quotes and make swaps between trading pairs in an Orca Pool
- Check your Orca Pool LP token balance and total supply

**Supported Orca Pools**

- The SDK supports all pools currently listed on [Orca](https://www.orca.so/pools)

### Provide Liquidity to Orca Pools

- Deposit liquidity to supported Orca Pools
  - Deposit a trading pair, and receive LP token
- Withdraw liquidity from supported Orca Pools
  - Withdraw a trading pair in exchange for LP token

**Aquafarm Support**

- After depositing liquidtiy to a pool, the LP token can be deposited into
  the corresponding farm to receive an equivalent amount of farm token
- Remember to withdraw the LP token in exchange for farm token before
  withdrawing liquidity from Orca Pool

**DoubleDip Support**

- For farms with double-dip, the aquafarm tokens can be deposited into
  double-dip farm to receive double-dip rewards

**Features Coming Soon**

- More trader information (APY, Volume)

# Installation

Use your environment's package manager to install @orca-so/sdk and other related packages into your project.

```bash
yarn add @orca-so/sdk @solana/web3.js decimal.js
```

```bash
npm install @orca-so/sdk @solana/web3.js decimal.js
```

# Usage

```typescript
import { readFile } from "mz/fs";
import { Connection, Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { getOrca, OrcaFarmConfig, OrcaPoolConfig } from "@orca-so/sdk";
import Decimal from "decimal.js";

const main = async () => {
  /*** Setup ***/
  // 1. Read secret key file to get owner keypair
  const secretKeyString = await readFile("/Users/scuba/my-wallet/my-keypair.json", {
    encoding: "utf8",
  });
  const secretKey = Uint8Array.from(JSON.parse(secretKeyString));
  const owner = Keypair.fromSecretKey(secretKey);

  // 2. Initialzie Orca object with mainnet connection
  const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com", "singleGossip");
  const orca = getOrca(connection);

  try {
    /*** Swap ***/
    // 3. We will be swapping 0.1 SOL for some ORCA
    const orcaSolPool = orca.getPool(OrcaPoolConfig.ORCA_SOL);
    const solToken = orcaSolPool.getTokenB();
    const solAmount = new Decimal(0.1);
    const quote = await orcaSolPool.getQuote(solToken, solAmount);
    const orcaAmount = quote.getMinOutputAmount();

    console.log(`Swap ${solAmount.toString()} SOL for at least ${orcaAmount.toNumber()} ORCA`);
    const swapPayload = await orcaSolPool.swap(owner, solToken, solAmount, orcaAmount);
    const swapTxId = await swapPayload.execute();
    console.log("Swapped:", swapTxId, "\n");

    /*** Pool Deposit ***/
    // 4. Deposit SOL and ORCA for LP token
    const { maxTokenAIn, maxTokenBIn, minPoolTokenAmountOut } = await orcaSolPool.getDepositQuote(
      orcaAmount,
      solAmount
    );

    console.log(
      `Deposit at most ${maxTokenBIn.toNumber()} SOL and ${maxTokenAIn.toNumber()} ORCA, for at least ${minPoolTokenAmountOut.toNumber()} LP tokens`
    );
    const poolDepositPayload = await orcaSolPool.deposit(
      owner,
      maxTokenAIn,
      maxTokenBIn,
      minPoolTokenAmountOut
    );
    const poolDepositTxId = await poolDepositPayload.execute();
    console.log("Pool deposited:", poolDepositTxId, "\n");

    /*** Farm Deposit ***/
    // 5. Deposit some ORCA_SOL LP token for farm token
    const lpBalance = await orcaSolPool.getLPBalance(owner.publicKey);
    const orcaSolFarm = orca.getFarm(OrcaFarmConfig.ORCA_SOL_AQ);
    const farmDepositPayload = await orcaSolFarm.deposit(owner, lpBalance);
    const farmDepositTxId = await farmDepositPayload.execute();
    console.log("Farm deposited:", farmDepositTxId, "\n");
    // Note 1: for double dip, repeat step 5 but with the double dip farm
    // Note 2: to harvest reward, orcaSolFarm.harvest(owner)
    // Note 3: to get harvestable reward amount, orcaSolFarm.getHarvestableAmount(owner.publicKey)

    /*** Farm Withdraw ***/
    // 6. Withdraw ORCA_SOL LP token, in exchange for farm token
    const farmBalance = await orcaSolFarm.getFarmBalance(owner.publicKey); // withdraw the entire balance
    const farmWithdrawPayload = await orcaSolFarm.withdraw(owner, farmBalance);
    const farmWithdrawTxId = await farmWithdrawPayload.execute();
    console.log("Farm withdrawn:", farmWithdrawTxId, "\n");

    /*** Pool Withdraw ***/
    // 6. Withdraw SOL and ORCA, in exchange for ORCA_SOL LP token
    const withdrawTokenAmount = await orcaSolPool.getLPBalance(owner.publicKey);
    const withdrawTokenMint = orcaSolPool.getPoolTokenMint();
    const { maxPoolTokenAmountIn, minTokenAOut, minTokenBOut } = await orcaSolPool.getWithdrawQuote(
      withdrawTokenAmount,
      withdrawTokenMint
    );

    console.log(
      `Withdraw at most ${maxPoolTokenAmountIn.toNumber()} ORCA_SOL LP token for at least ${minTokenAOut.toNumber()} ORCA and ${minTokenBOut.toNumber()} SOL`
    );
    const poolWithdrawPayload = await orcaSolPool.withdraw(
      owner,
      maxPoolTokenAmountIn,
      minTokenAOut,
      minTokenBOut
    );
    const poolWithdrawTxId = await poolWithdrawPayload.execute();
    console.log("Pool withdrawn:", poolWithdrawTxId, "\n");
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn(err);
  }

main()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Done");
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e);
  });
```

# Devnet Testing

The example code above can be run on devnet by updating the import statement:

```typescript
import { getOrca, OrcaFarmConfig, OrcaPoolConfig, Network } from "@orca-so/sdk";
```

And changing two lines of code like so:

```typescript
const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com", "singleGossip");
const orca = getOrca(connection, Network.DEVNET);
```

One caveat to note is that there are only a few devnet pools available, so if you try to access pools that are only
available on mainnet, the code will throw an error. The example code uses ORCA_SOL, which exists on the devnet.

# Technical Notes

**Decimals & OrcaU64**

The SDK relies on the use of [Decimal](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js/) for number inputs and Decimal/[OrcaU64](https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk/blob/main/src/public/utils/orca-u64.ts) for token-value inputs. If a Decimal instance is provided for a token-value input, it will be automatically transformed to the token's scale.

**Stability of the Public Util Functions**

We hope you find the tools we used to build our API useful in the public/utils folder. Due to our on-going development of the Orca platform, we cannot guarrantee the stability of the util APIs. The trading APIs can only be upgraded on major version updates.
