# Orca Typescript SDK

The Orca SDK contains a set of simple to use APIs to allow developers to integrate with the Orca exchange platform.

Learn more Orca [here](https://docs.orca.so).

## Trading Orca Liquidity Pools

- Get detailed quotes and make swaps between trading pairs in an Orca Pool
- Check your Orca Pool LP token balance and total supply

**Supported Orca Pools**

- SOLUSDC, SOLUSDT, RAYSOL, ETHSOL, ETHUSDC
- More coming in the future!

# Installation

Use your environment's package manager to install @orca-so/sdk and other related packages into your project.

```bash
yarn add @orca.so/sdk @solana/web3.js decimal.js
```

```bash
npm install @orca.so/sdk @solana/web3.js decimal.js
```

# Usage

```typescript
import { Connection, Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { getOrca, OrcaPoolConfig, OrcaU64 } from "@orca-so/sdk";

try {
  const connection = new Connection(url, "singleGossip");
  const orca = getOrca(connection);
  const owner: Keypair = getKeyPair();

  // Get an instance of the ETH-USDC orca pool
  let pool = orca.getPool(OrcaPoolConfig.ETH_USDC);

  // Get the number of ETH-USDC LP tokens in your wallet
  let ethUsdcLPBalance = await pool.getLPBalance(owner.publicKey);

  // Get the total supply of ETH-USDC LP tokens
  let ethUsdcLPSupply = await pool.getLPSupply();

  // Get a quote of exchanging 1.1 ETH to USDC with a slippage tolerance of 0.1%
  // From the quote, you can get the current rate, fees, expected output amount and minimum output amount
  let usdcToken = pool.getTokenB();
  let tradeValue = new Decimal(1.1);
  let quote = await pool.getQuote(usdcToken, tradeValue, new Decimal(0.1));

  // Perform a swap for 1USDC to the quoted minimum amount of ETH
  const txId = await pool.swap(owner, usdcToken, tradeValue, quote.getMinOutputAmount());
} catch (err) {
  // Handle errors
}
```

# Technical Notes

**Decimals & OrcaU64**
The SDK relies on the use of [Decimal](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js/) for number inputs and Decimal/[OrcaU64](https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk/blob/main/src/public/utils/orca-u64.ts) for token-value inputs. If a Decimal instance is provided for a token-value input, it will be automatically transformed to the token's scale.

**Funding Associated Token Addresses**
The swap() function assumes the owner keypair address has already created & initialized the [associated token addresses](https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account) for the trading pair tokens. The swap will fail if this is not the case.
